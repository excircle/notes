# Why I Am Learning Data Science On My Own

After reviewing the curriculum at a prominent data science bootcamp in Seattle, I've learned a few things.

1.) That the course work is challenging.

2.) That the specific subjects in this challenging coursework cannot be learned in a week (like the bootcamp is suggesting).

3.) I will have to teach myself these subjects (with or without the school).

From the website and from the propaganda that is on the web, it seems that these data science boot camps will offer cozy, personal, classroom experience that will intimately answer all your questions for you and leave you feeling enlightened, educated, and confident in this advanced subject.

WRONG!

The amount of self-teaching and "on your own" learning is HUGE. These bootcamps can offer quick tips but nothing more.

It is poorly explained (but well understood to me now) that entering into these bootcamps, one should be moderately talented in all the given subjects ([linear, relational,] algebra, pre-calculus, calculus, probability, statistics, python, R, SQL, Javascript, etc)  so that the school and assist you in a few areas relative to these subjects of study.

HAH!

This is an audacious and really ridiculous thing to sell to people trying to improve their career skills.

Why?

The ramp up time to be moderately talented in data science subjects is roughly 6-12 months. To become proficient in the advanced subject will take (by my estimate) at another 6-12 months.

That is far longer than these bootcamps.

I no longer believe it to be possible to adequately learn these subjects in the convenient time frame offered.

Therefore, effective March 9th, 2020, I am creating my own data science curriculum, and teaching myself (FOR FREE) what these coding bootcamp attempted to charge me 18k for.

These subjects are very advanced and require more than a 3-month intensive course to become competent
