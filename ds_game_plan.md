# Why I Am Learning Data Science On My Own

After reviewing the curriculum at a prominent data science bootcamp in Seattle, I've learned a few things.

<b>1.)</b> That the course work is challenging.</br>
<b>2.)</b> That the specific subjects in this challenging coursework cannot be learned in a week (like the bootcamp is suggesting).</br>
<b>3.)</b> I will have to teach myself these subjects (with or without the school).</br>

From the website and from the propaganda that is on the web, it seems that these data science boot camps will offer cozy, personal, classroom experience that will intimately answer all your questions for you and leave you feeling enlightened, educated, and confident in this advanced subject.

<b>WRONG!</b>

The amount of self-teaching and "on your own" learning is <b>HUGE</b>. These bootcamps can offer quick tips but nothing more.

It is poorly explained (but well understood to me now) that entering into these bootcamps, one should be moderately talented in all the given subjects ([linear, relational,] algebra, pre-calculus, calculus, probability, statistics, python, R, SQL, Javascript, etc)  so that the school and assist you in a few areas relative to these subjects of study.

<b>HAH!</b>

This is an audacious and really ridiculous thing to sell to people trying to improve their career skills.

<b>Why?</b>

The ramp up time to be moderately talented in data science subjects is roughly 6-12 months. To become proficient in the advanced subject will take (by my estimate) at another 6-12 months.

That is far longer than these bootcamps.

I no longer believe it to be possible to adequately learn these subjects in the convenient time frame offered.

These subjects are very advanced and require more than a 3-month intensive course to become competent.

<b>Therefore, effective March 9th, 2020, I am creating my own data science curriculum, and teaching myself (FOR FREE)</b>

# My Learning Keystones

To explain how I plan to teach myself all this stuff, I plan to illustrate the types of learning I'll be putting myself through

The below items, which I will refer to as <b>Learning Keystones,</b> explain what I plan to do to master skills.


<b>1.) Book Analysis:</b> I will read a book per section of the "Custom Curriculum" listed further below in this document.</br>
<b>2.) Web Modules:</b> I will be creating a <b>Django Web App</b> to quiz and test myself. Each section will have quiz modules.</br>
<b>3.) Portfolio Additions:</b> This GitHub will be my Data Science learning repo. I will add code, Jupyter Notebooks, and general documentation as I learn the subjects.</br>
<b>4.) Living Projects:</b> I will create Kubernetes clusters or Docker containers demonstrating compentency in each given section.</br>
<b>5.) Blog Post:</b> I will add my overview of each given subject on my personal blog as I complete sections.</br>

As of right now (3/9/2020), my work will be evenly divided among these subjects.

# My Plan To Learn Data Science

This is an adapted version of the Data Science bootcamp I was going to attend. The numbered subjects below encompass 1 week of would have been the bootcamp training I was slated to do. 

As you continue reading this document, I will have a section dedicated to how I plan to teach myself these subjects, and how each subject will be turned into a "Learning Keystone".

1. [Software Eng & Data Exploring](#Software-Eng-&-Data-Exploring)
2. [Statistics and Probability](#Statistics-and-Probability)
3. [Regression](#Regression)
4. [Supervised Learning](#Supervised-Learning)
5. [Natural Language Processing](#Natural-Language-Processing)
6. [Unsupervised Learning](#Unsupervised-Learning)
7. [Data Engineering](#Data-Engineering)
8. [Case Studies](#Case-Studies)
9. [Capstone Projects](#Capstone-Projects)
10. [Interview Preparation](#Interview-Preparation)

## Software Eng & Data Exploring

Software engineering principles are common and very well documented. Having worked in Linux administration myself for over 8 years, I already adhere to several professional software engineering practices.

I have listed the Software eng skills I plan to follow below.

<b><u>Software Eng Principles</u></b>
```Java
-Understanding Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
	--Project Conception
	--System Architecture
	--QA/Testing/Acceptance/Maintenance

- Methodologies
	-Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban
	-Using GIT
	-Employing a CI/CD system
-Python Software Development
	-Using an IDE
	-Adhering to PEP8
	-Unit Testing


```

The following books will supply source material.
